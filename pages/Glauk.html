      <h1>Cristianoc Ronaldo</h1>

      <p> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu] ⓘ; born 5 February 1985) 
   is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both the Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and
   the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won numerous individual
   accolades throughout his career, such as five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, four 
   European Golden Shoes, and was named five times the world's best player by FIFA,[note 3] the most by a European player. 
  He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European 
 Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists
  (42) in the Champions League, most appearances (30), assists (8), goals in the European Championship (14), international
  appearances (217) and international goals (135). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career 
  appearances, the most by an outfield player,
  and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.[note 4]
  Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning
  the FA Cup in his first season. He went on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions
  League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of
  the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer
  worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema
  and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including 
  La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017,
  and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time
  top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top 
  scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, 
  two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed 
  for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for
  an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana
  trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player, and the first footballer
  to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United 
  in 2021, finishing his only full season 
  as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.</p>

      <p> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[11][12] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha.[13][14][15] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16.[16][17] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Kátia".[2] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[18] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[19][20] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[21]

        As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[22] where his father was the kit man,[13] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[23] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system.[23] By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[24] to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[25][26] With a troubled life as a student,[27] and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family,[28][29] he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[30][31] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[25] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[32] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[33] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[34] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.[35]
        
        Growing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário, and has described them as leaving "a beautiful history in football".[36]</p>
